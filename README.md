# "Golf" with Python and Pyglet

I created this demo in 2013 as a follow-up to [pyglet-asteroids](https://github.com/jameskirkwood/pyglet-asteroids). It isn't golf, but the ball does bounce off the walls while experiencing gravitational attraction to the rocky spheres.

# Quick Start

```sh
pip3 install pyglet
python3 play_game.py
```

Have fun and feel free to study the code :)
